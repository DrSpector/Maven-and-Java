Product goal: Enable Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to make queries
against a database of immigrants. DHS personnel should then be able to confirm if an
immigrant's status permits modification, and if so be able to make those modifications. The
application shall also abide by all DHS formatting guidelines.
